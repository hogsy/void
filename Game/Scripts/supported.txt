-nothing is case sensitive
-if you write new shader files, make sure they don't start on the first line.  The first line is always skipped.


=============================
All supported shader keywords
=============================


sky or skybrush
----------
Changes a brush to a sky brush (always rendered as if viewed from (0,0,0)).


origintexture
----------
Calculates texture coords as if viewed from the origin.  Mostly used with skybrushes.


skyview
----------
Changes a brush to a skyview brush.  When rendered, skybrushes are drawn instead.  Use these on windows.


invisible
----------
The side is not drawn.


nonsolid
----------
All brushes are solid by default.  This keyword makes any brush it is on nonsolid.


depthfunc <func>
----------
Set the depthtest function.  lequal by default.
func = lequal, equal, always, none


qer_editorimage
----------
Does nothing in Void.



============================
All supported layer keywords
============================


tcgen <source>
----------
Determins how texture coordinates are generated.
base
	same as q3
lightmap
	same as q3
sky
	use base coords as if viewed from the origin - use with sky/skybrush 	shader keyword
vector ( <sx> <sy> <sz> ) ( <tx> <ty> <tz> )
	Same as q3.  Must be spaces on both sides of ('s and )'s or there will be errors parsing this keyword.


tcmod <func> <...>
----------
Modify texture coordinates.
scroll <sSpeed> <tSpeed>
	same as q3
scale <sScale> <tScale>
	same as q3


map <texture>
----------
Same as q3.  $lightmap = unique lightmap for each side.  Repeats texture.


clampmap <texture>
----------
Not sure if this is the same as q3.  Same as map <texture> but clamps texture coordinates to 0..1.


animmap <freq> <texture1> ... <texture8>
----------
Same as q3.  Only use up to 7 textures right now though.


blendfunc <func>
blendfunc <source> <dest>
----------
Same as q3.
func = add, filter, blend
sources and dests same as q3.  Also accepted without gl_ prefix.


alphagen <source>
----------
Where alpha component comes from.
Source = identity (default), console


depthwrite
----------
Force writing to depthbuffer.  Must be after the blend func or it will be overriden.


nomipmap
----------
Don't create mipmaps for this texture.
